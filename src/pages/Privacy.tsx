          PizzaDAO is a global community built around pizza, generosity, and
          the people who show up. This Privacy Policy explains what
          information we collect when you visit our websites, attend our
          events, or participate in our digital experiences — and what we do
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to collect as little as possible, keep it for as short as
          possible, and never sell it. If something here is unclear, write to
          us and we'll do our best to plainly explain.
